=======================================================================

This is the source distribution of Tidbits.

The source is structured as an Eclipse 3.2 (or later) project, using 
the EclipseWeb Tools Platform for support. You can import this directory
into Eclipse as a project, then you need only to configure a Tomcat server
to provide the J2EE libraries required by the project. It also requires
the IveDE Eclipse plugin.
