Tidbits Release Notes

@VERSION@ @BUILD_DATE@

This is a minor update that inclues a UI enhancement and an updated
build system to works with git.

Updates in this release:

- Fix invalid HTML (<li> within <p> not allowed).

- Update commons-fileupload to 1.3.2 to pick up security fix.

- Update Lucene to 2.9.4.

- Add missing semicolons to Postgres initialization SQL.

- Remove internal HTTP response gzip compression. If this is 
  desired still, all modern servlet containers like Tomcat support
  configuring response compression based on the response content
  type.

- Fix bug in parsing ISO 8601 formatted dates during CSV import.
  This fixes errors when trying to import CSV exported from
  Tidbits.

- Fix display bug in the import data verification step, where
  the form was shown flipped like in a mirror, or not at all.
