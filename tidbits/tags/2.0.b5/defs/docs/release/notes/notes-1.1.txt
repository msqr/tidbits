Tidbits Release Notes

@VERSION@ @BUILD_DATE@

This update is contains some UI changes to make the application more
streamlined, as well as updates to some of the core frameworks used
internally by Tidbits.

*** NOTE **************************************************************

The database schema has changed slightly in this release. You should
not run this against an installation of Tidbits 1.0. First make sure
you back up your Tidbits 1.0 database, shut down the Tidbits server,
and then run the provided upgrade-1.0-1.1.sql SQL script (in the 
setup/sql/<db> directory) against the 1.0 database. This script will
update your Tidbits 1.0 database to the new schema. Once upgraded, 
bring the Tidbits 1.1 application up.
