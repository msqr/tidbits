Tidbits Release Notes

@VERSION@ @BUILD_DATE@

This is a major update that updates the core frameworks used internally
by Tidbits to more modern versions and changes the UI into an "index 
card" metaphore using HTML5 features. Tidbits has been designed for use 
with modern web browsers, including mobile browsers, and makes use of 
advanced HTML5 functionality. As such, it will not work in older browsers.

Tidbits now uses Spring Secrity 3.1 instead of Acegi Security for
authentication and authorization services. This means the old
securityContext.xml file required by Tidbits 1.2 or earlier will no
longer work with Tidbits 2, and must be converted. The configuration
is greatly simplified with Spring Security, however, so this conversion
should be easy to do in most situations.

These are the browser versions tested with Tidbits:

  - Safari 5+
  - Chrome 24+
  - Firefox 6+
  - IE 10.0.9200.16438 (limited editing support)
  - Opera 12 (editing not supported)

Updates in this release:

- Major UI overhaul, using HTML5.

- Update to Spring Framework 3.1 from 1.2.

- Update to Spring Security 3.1 from Acegi Security 1.0.

- Update to HyperJAXB 3 from HyperJAXB 2.

- Update to JPA 2 provided by EclipseLink from Hibernate.

- Update build infrastructure to use Apache Ivy for dependency resolution.
